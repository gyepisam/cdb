How to install cdb

Like any other piece of software (and information generally), cdb comes with NO
WARRANTY.

System requirements

cdb works only under UNIX.

Installation

Download the cdb package. The latest published cdb package is cdb-0.75.tar.gz.

Unpack the cdb package:

     gunzip cdb-0.75.tar
     tar -xf cdb-0.75.tar
     cd cdb-0.75

Compile the cdb programs:

     make

As root, install the cdb programs under /usr/local:

     make setup check

Automatic tests

You need the softlimit program for these tests:

     make rts
     ./rts > rts.out
     cmp rts.out rts.exp

Normally this prints nothing.

Beware that, starting with version 0.75, rts takes some time to run: e.g., 155
seconds on a Pentium II-350. (It writes three 4GB databases to /dev/null.)

Manual tests

Create a database from /etc/services:

     ./cdbmake-sv test.cdb test.tmp < /etc/services

Use cdbtest to test the database:

     ./cdbtest < test.cdb

The bad length and not found tallies should be 0. The different record tally
should be 0 unless you have the same service listed on several lines in /etc/
services.

Try retrieving particular records from the database:

     ./cdbget smtp/tcp < test.cdb && echo ''
     ./cdbget @25/tcp < test.cdb && echo ''

Try printing some database statistics:

     ./cdbstats < test.cdb

The numbers should decrease rapidly past d0.

To report success:

     ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
     | mail djb-sysdeps@cr.yp.to

Replace First M. Last with your name.
